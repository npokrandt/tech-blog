//console.log('nice mustache')

// GIVEN a CMS-style blog site
// WHEN I click on one of my existing posts in the dashboard 
// THEN I am able to delete or update my post and taken back to an updated dashboard - the only one left?

//if a user is in their post, they should see the edit and delete buttons (handlebars thing)

//edit just takes them to the same page as earlier, but with the text bars filled in

//delete is easy - just delete the post in question
